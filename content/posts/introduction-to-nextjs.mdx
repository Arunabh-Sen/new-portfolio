Chakravyuh is a personal Visual Studio Code theme I created to bring clarity, consistency, and comfort to my coding environment. Designed with focus in mind, it balances contrast and subtlety without compromising readability.

## Motivation

Most themes offer either high visual noise or very muted colors with low contrast. I wanted something that felt sharp, but not overwhelming — optimized for long hours of development, across various programming languages and file types.

## Key Features

- Dark base background (`#0F111A`) that reduces eye strain
- Soft foreground text (`#D8DEE9`) for comfortable reading
- Carefully tuned syntax colors for clarity and differentiation
- Minimal UI styling with muted borders and highlights
- Consistent token handling across JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and more

## Syntax Color Reference

- **Background**: `#0F111A`
- **Foreground**: `#D8DEE9`
- **Keyword**: `#C792EA`
- **String**: `#A3BE8C`
- **Comment**: `#5C6370`
- **Function**: `#82AAFF`

This example demonstrates how keywords, functions, and string literals are visually distinct while maintaining overall balance.

## Installation

Currently, Chakravyuh is available for local development use. Marketplace publishing is planned.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arunabh-Sen/chakravyuh-theme-vsc.git
```

### Step 2: Open in Visual Studio Code

```bash
cd chakravyuh-theme-vsc
cd .
```

### Step 3: Launch the theme in a Dev Host

Open the command palette and run the extension using:
```vbnet
Developer: Reload with Extensions
```

### Conclusion

Chakravyuh is a reflection of my own preferences as a developer, a theme that's visually stable, minimal, and consistent across environments. If you're looking for a no-frills coding experience with a refined dark aesthetic, it may be worth exploring.
